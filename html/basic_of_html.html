	   <P>Baahubali stood against his kingdom to marry Devasena,so he left mahishmati and seeing this as a threat, the newly appointed king bhallaladeva wanted him dead.
	   kattappa killed baahubali "because it was his duty to secure the king of Mahishmati and he is a slave of throne"as he said in Baahubali-1.</p>
